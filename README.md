# First and Second Order Shape Optimization based on Restricted Mesh Deformations
This is an implementation of the shape optimization algorithms
from the paper "First and Second Order Shape Optimization based on Restricted Mesh Deformations"
by Tommy Etling, Roland Herzog, Estefanía Loayza and Gerd Wachsmuth,
see [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10313).

The numerical examples from the paper can be invoked via
